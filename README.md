## 1. What is this

 This is a fork of bashacks by Fernando MercÃªs, mainly to do some
 development.

## 2. Additional Requirements

* `whois`

## 3. Additional Functions

* `bh_asinfo`: Look up AS information in Team Cymru's `whois` for a given
  AS.  (The string `AS` is prepended to the argument if it is not
  included.)
  Examples:
  ```
  tdussa@flattop ~ $ bh_asinfo 32868        
  AS      | CC | Registry | Allocated  | AS Name
  32868   | US | arin     | 2004-08-10 | FLEX-DATASIDE-AS01, US
  ```
  ```
  tdussa@flattop ~ $ bh_asinfo AS1  
  AS      | CC | Registry | Allocated  | AS Name
  1       | US | arin     | 2001-09-20 | LVLT-1, US
  ```

* `bh_ip2as`: Look up AS information in Team Cymru's `whois` for a given
  IP.
  Example:
  ```
  tdussa@flattop ~ $ bh_ip2as 129.13.64.5
  AS      | IP               | AS Name
  34878   | 129.13.64.5      | KIT Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, DE
  ```

* `bh_ip2cymru`: Look up all information provided by Team Cymru for a
  given IP.
  Example:
  ```
  tdussa@flattop ~ $ bh_ip2cymru 129.13.64.5
  AS      | IP               | BGP Prefix          | CC | Registry | Allocated  | AS Name
  34878   | 129.13.64.5      | 129.13.0.0/16       | DE | ripencc  | 1987-06-29 | KIT Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, DE
  ```

* `bh_ip2irt`: Look up abuse contact information and the relevant IRT
  object in `whois` for a given IP.
  Example:
  ```
  tdussa@flattop ~ $ bh_ip2irt 129.13.64.5
  % Abuse contact for '129.13.0.0 - 129.13.255.255' is 'cert@kit.edu'
